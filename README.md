# Anonymous Message Board

A simple, anonymous message board web application built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and SQLite3, containerized using Docker and Docker Compose. This application features a pure dark mode interface, support for Markdown content, and allows users to post, edit, and delete messages anonymously.

![Preview of the Application](PreviewImage.jpg)

## Features

*   **Anonymous Posting**: Share your thoughts without revealing your identity.
*   **Pure Dark Mode**: A sleek, modern dark theme is enforced throughout the application. No theme switching needed.
*   **SQLite3 Database**: Lightweight and efficient data storage.
*   **Data Persistence**: All messages are stored persistently using Docker volumes, ensuring your data is safe across container restarts.
*   **Markdown Support**: Write messages using Markdown syntax (headings, bold, italics, lists, code blocks, etc.), which will be rendered beautifully.
*   **Edit & Delete Messages**: Users can edit their previously posted messages or delete them.
*   **Private Messages with KEY Protection**: Post private messages protected by a KEY. Only users who know the correct KEY can view these messages.
*   **User Authentication**: Register and login system with session-based authentication.
*   **User-Specific Private Messages**: Logged-in users can view all their private messages without entering KEYs individually.
*   **File Upload Support**: Upload and display files in messages (one file per message, max 50MB, supports all file types). Images show previews, other files show download links.
*   **Pagination with Google-Style Navigation**: Messages are displayed with Google search results-style pagination (e.g., < 1 2 3 4 5 ... 100 >). Each page shows 5 messages with previous/next buttons and direct page navigation.
*   **Database Performance Optimization**: Built-in indexes for faster queries, better scalability for research and learning.
*   **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be accessible and usable across various devices, with mobile-friendly buttons.

*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (configured for `darkMode: 'class'`)
*   **Client-side Logic**: Native JavaScript (Fetch API)
*   **Markdown Rendering**: Showdown.js
*   **File Upload**: Multer for handling file uploads (all types, up to 50MB)
*   **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

*   [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Important Note for Cross-Platform Compatibility

sqlite3 is a native Node.js module that needs to be compiled on specific platform architectures. Binaries compiled on Windows are not compatible with Linux Docker containers.

To rebuild the container: Reinstall and recompile all dependencies inside the container
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/carterwayneskhizeine/AnonymousMessageBoard.git
    cd AnonymousMessageBoard
    ```

2.  **Build and run the application using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```
    This command will:
    *   Build the Docker image for the `message-board` service based on the `Dockerfile`.
    *   Install all Node.js dependencies, including Tailwind CSS and Showdown.js.
    *   Run the Tailwind CSS build process.
    *   Start the `message-board` container in detached mode (`-d`).
    *   Map port `1989` from your host to the container.
    *   Mount a local `./data` directory to `/app/data` inside the container for SQLite database persistence.

### Accessing the Application

Once the Docker containers are up and running, open your web browser and navigate to:

    *   Anonymous users can still create and view private messages using KEYs
    *   Logged-in users can access both types

### API Usage with curl

You can interact with the message board API directly using `curl` commands. This is useful for testing, automation, or integration with other tools.

#### Basic Message Operations

**1. Get all public messages**
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:1989/api/messages"
```

**2. Post a public message**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"content\": \"Your message here\"}"
```

**3. Post a private message with KEY**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"content\": \"Secret message\", \"isPrivate\": true, \"privateKey\": \"your-secret-key\"}"
```

**4. View private messages with KEY**
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:1989/api/messages?privateKey=your-secret-key"
```

**5. Get messages with pagination**
```bash
# Get page 1 (default, 5 messages per page)
curl -s "http://localhost:1989/api/messages?page=1&limit=5"

# Get page 2 with private key
curl -s "http://localhost:1989/api/messages?page=2&limit=5&privateKey=your-secret-key"

# Get page 3 as logged-in user (with session cookie)
curl -s "http://localhost:1989/api/messages?page=3&limit=5" -b cookies.txt
```

#### User Authentication API

**6. Register a new user**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"username\": \"testuser\", \"password\": \"password123\"}"
```

**7. Login (creates a session cookie)**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"username\": \"testuser\", \"password\": \"password123\"}" \
  -c cookies.txt
```

**8. Get current user info (with session cookie)**
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:1989/api/auth/me" \
  -b cookies.txt
```

**9. Logout**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/auth/logout" \
  -b cookies.txt
```

#### File Upload API

**10. Upload a file (any type)**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/upload-file" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.pdf" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```

**11. Post a message with file (two-step process)**
```bash
# Step 1: Upload the file
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/upload-file" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.pdf" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -o upload-response.json

# Step 2: Post message with file reference
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(cat <<'EOF'
{
  "content": "Message with file",
  "hasImage": true,
  "imageFilename": "$(jq -r '.filename' upload-response.json)",
  "imageMimeType": "$(jq -r '.mimeType' upload-response.json)",
  "imageSize": $(jq -r '.size' upload-response.json)
}
EOF
)"
```

**12. Post private message with file**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"content\": \"Private file message\", \"isPrivate\": true, \"privateKey\": \"secret123\", \"hasImage\": true, \"imageFilename\": \"1734267890123_abc123_document.pdf\", \"imageMimeType\": \"application/pdf\", \"imageSize\": 512000}"
```

**13. Backward compatibility - Upload an image using the original endpoint**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/upload" \
  -F "image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```

#### Advanced Examples

**13. Post message as logged-in user (with session cookie)**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"content\": \"Message from logged-in user\"}" \
  -b cookies.txt
```

**14. Post private message as logged-in user (auto-generates KEY)**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:1989/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"content\": \"Private message from user\", \"isPrivate\": true}" \
  -b cookies.txt
```

**15. Get messages for logged-in user (shows user's private messages)**
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:1989/api/messages" \
  -b cookies.txt
```

#### Tips
- Use `-s` flag for silent mode (no progress meter)
- Use `-v` flag for verbose output to see request/response headers
- Save cookies with `-c cookies.txt` and reuse with `-b cookies.txt`
- For Windows PowerShell, use double quotes and escape inner quotes with backtick (`)
- For Windows CMD, use double quotes and escape inner quotes with backslash (\\)

#### Examples in Other Languages
Examples using JavaScript (fetch/axios), Python (requests/aiohttp), and Node.js follow the same patterns as the curl examples above. Use `credentials: 'include'` or session handling for authentication.

### Markdown Examples

You can use standard Markdown syntax in your messages, for example:

## Development

If you make changes to the code, especially to `package.json`, `src/index.js`, `public/js/main.js`, `src/input.css`, `tailwind.config.js`, or the `Dockerfile`, you will need to rebuild the Docker image to apply these changes:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

This ensures that any new dependencies are installed, CSS is recompiled, and your latest code is included in the running container.

**Note:** This command is typically used after making code changes that affect the application's dependencies or build process.

### Clearing the Database

If you need to clear all messages and start fresh, you can delete the database files. The application uses two SQLite database files stored in the `./data/` directory:

1. **`messages.db`** - Stores all messages (public and private)
2. **`sessions.db`** - Stores user session data

Additionally, uploaded files (images and other types) are stored in the `./data/uploads/` directory.

#### Method 1: Stop containers and delete files (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop the running containers
docker compose down

# Delete the database files and uploaded images
rm -f data/messages.db data/sessions.db
rm -rf data/uploads/*
# Restart the containers (new databases will be created automatically)
docker compose up -d
```

#### Method 2: Delete files while containers are running
```bash
# Delete the database files and uploaded images
rm -f data/messages.db data/sessions.db
rm -rf data/uploads/*

# Restart the application container to recreate databases
docker compose restart message-board
```

#### Method 3: Using a one-liner command
```bash
docker compose down && rm -f data/messages.db data/sessions.db && rm -rf data/uploads/* && docker compose up -d
```

**Note**:
- Deleting `sessions.db` will log out all users
- Deleting `messages.db` will remove ALL messages permanently
- Deleting files in `data/uploads/` will remove ALL uploaded files
- The application will automatically create new empty databases when restarted
- User accounts are stored in `messages.db`, so deleting it will also remove all user accounts
